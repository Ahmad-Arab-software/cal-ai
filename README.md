## ‚ú® Core Features

### 1. Dashboard

The central hub of the app, providing an at-a-glance summary of the user's daily
progress.

- **Dynamic Summary:** Shows calories remaining, macro consumption (protein,
  carbs, fat), and progress towards daily goals.
- **AI Insights:** A smart card offers context-aware tips and reminders, like
  suggesting a walk or reminding the user to log a meal.
- **Streak Counter:** Motivates users by displaying their daily logging streak.
- **Water & Step Tracking:** Interactive UI to easily log water intake and
  steps.
- **Meal & Activity Logs:** A clear list of meals and activities logged for the
  day, with options to edit, delete, or log again.
- **Today's Plan Integration:** Displays planned meals for the day, allowing for
  quick one-tap logging.

### 2. AI-Powered Meal Logging

Multiple intuitive methods to log food and activities.

- **Scan a Meal:** Users can take or upload a photo of their meal. The Gemini AI
  analyzes the image, identifies ingredients, and returns a complete nutritional
  breakdown (calories, macros, etc.).
- **Scan Barcode/Product:** The AI can analyze images of packaged food or
  barcodes, using Google Search grounding to find and return accurate
  nutritional information for the specific product.
- **Manual Entry with AI Suggestions:** As users type a food name, the AI
  provides a list of common foods and their serving sizes, pre-filling
  nutritional data.
- **Log from Favorites:** Save frequently eaten foods for quick and easy logging
  in the future.
- **Recipe Builder:** Create custom recipes by listing ingredients. The app
  automatically calculates the nutritional information per serving.

### 3. Meal Planner

A weekly planner to help users organize their meals in advance.

- **Weekly View:** A clear, seven-day calendar view.
- **Add to Plan:** Users can add their favorite foods and created recipes to any
  meal slot (Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner, Snacks).
- **Seamless Logging:** Planned meals for the current day appear on the
  dashboard for easy logging.

### 4. Progress Tracking & Insights

A dedicated screen for visualizing long-term progress and discovering trends.

- **Interactive Charts:** Line charts display trends for calories, macros,
  steps, and weight over various timeframes (7 days, 30 days, 1 year, etc.).
- **Chart Tooltips:** Click on any data point in the chart to see its specific
  value and date.
- **Daily Goal Progress:** Progress bars show how the user is tracking against
  their goals for the current day.
- **Data-Driven Insights:** The app analyzes historical data to provide insights
  like the top 5 most logged foods, the time of day with the highest calorie
  intake, and the average macro balance.
- **Achievements & Challenges:** A gamified system to reward consistency and
  healthy habits (e.g., "Log meals 7 days in a row").

### 5. AI Coach ("Cal")

A conversational AI assistant for personalized guidance and support.

- **Context-Aware Chat:** "Cal" has access to the user's daily log and goals,
  allowing it to provide tailored advice (e.g., "What's a good high-protein
  snack?").
- **Natural Conversation:** Powered by the Gemini API's chat model for a
  friendly and encouraging conversational experience.
- **Voice Input:** Users can speak their questions directly into the chat using
  their device's microphone.

### 6. Settings & Personalization

Comprehensive options for customizing the app experience.

- **Custom Goals:** Set personal daily targets for calories, macros, water, and
  steps.
- **Preferences:** Choose between light/dark themes, select an accent color,
  switch languages (English, Dutch, Arabic), and set weight units (lbs/kg).
- **API Key Management:** A secure field for users to enter their Google AI API
  key.
- **Data Management:** Export all app data to a JSON file for backup or import
  data to restore the app's state.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Frontend Framework:** **React** (v19) with Hooks for state and lifecycle
  management.
- **AI & Machine Learning:** **Google Gemini API** (`@google/genai`) is used
  for:
  - **Image Analysis (`gemini-2.5-flash`):** For the "Scan a meal" feature,
    using a strict JSON schema for reliable output.
  - **Product Recognition (`gemini-2.5-flash` with Google Search):** For the
    "Scan Barcode" feature, grounding the model's knowledge in real-time search
    results.
  - **Conversational AI (`gemini-2.5-flash` Chat):** Powers the AI Coach "Cal".
  - **Text Generation (`gemini-2.5-flash`):** For providing food suggestions in
    the manual entry screen.
- **Styling:** Plain **CSS** with Custom Properties (CSS Variables) for robust
  theming (light/dark modes and accent colors). The layout is fully responsive
  for mobile devices.
- **State Management:** Local component state is managed with React's
  `useState`, `useMemo`, and `useCallback` hooks. App-wide state (like logs,
  goals, etc.) is held in the root `App` component and passed down via props.
- **Data Persistence:** The **`useLocalStorage`** custom hook is used to save
  all user data (logs, goals, settings) to the browser's Local Storage, ensuring
  data persistence between sessions.
- **Internationalization (i18n):** A custom solution using **React Context**
  (`LanguageProvider`) to provide translations for English, Dutch, and Arabic
  throughout the application.

## üìÇ Code Structure

The entire application is architected within three primary files for simplicity
and rapid development.

- **`index.html`**:

  - The single HTML entry point.
  - Sets up the `<div id="root">` where the React app is mounted.
  - Uses an `importmap` to manage JavaScript modules (React, Gemini AI) directly
    from a CDN, eliminating the need for a local build step.

- **`index.tsx`**:

  - The heart of the application, containing all the JavaScript and React code.
  - **Translations:** A `translations` object holds all UI strings for supported
    languages. The `LanguageProvider` and `useTranslations` hook make these
    available throughout the app.
  - **Types & Defaults:** All TypeScript types (`Meal`, `DailyLog`, etc.) and
    default constants (`DEFAULT_GOALS`) are defined at the top.
  - **AI Helpers:** Contains functions that prepare data and prompts for the
    Gemini API, including the JSON schemas (`analysisSchema`,
    `suggestionSchema`) that structure the AI's responses.
  - **UI Components:** A collection of reusable functional components (e.g.,
    `CircularProgress`, `LineChart`, `MealCard`).
  - **Screens & Modals:** Each major feature is encapsulated in its own "Screen"
    or "Modal" component (e.g., `DashboardScreen`, `CameraScreen`,
    `CoachScreen`).
  - **Root `App` Component:** This is the main component that orchestrates the
    entire application. It holds all the primary state using the
    `useLocalStorage` hook and manages which screen or modal is currently
    visible. All data handling functions (e.g., `handleSaveMeal`,
    `handleUpdateWater`) are defined here and passed down as props to child
    components.

- **`index.css`**:

  - A single CSS file containing all styles for the application.
  - Uses CSS variables (`:root`) to define the color palette for both light and
    dark themes, which are toggled by adding a `.dark` class to the `<html>`
    element.
  - Styles are organized logically by component or feature (e.g., Dashboard,
    Modals, Coach Screen).

- **`metadata.json`**:
  - Provides metadata about the application, including the permissions it
    requires (`camera`, `microphone`) to function correctly in a web frame
    environment.
